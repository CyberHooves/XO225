Stereo 2.5-way electronic crossover
===================================

This is a stereo two way electronic crossover with mono subwoofer output. All inputs and outputs are balanced.

This was designed with fixed crossover frequencies and fixed gains for fixed applications. Applications wherein an adjustible crossover would have it's knobs maladjusted by knobs resulting in awful sound and burnt voice coils.
